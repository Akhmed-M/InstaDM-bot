# InstaDM-bot
With this script, you can automatically send an Instagram DM everyday at the same time, to a user of your choice.


# How to use:
- Open the files in a text editor
- Enter your login information inside the "myInfo.py" file

# Notes:
The file needs to be running 24/7
Do not shutdown your device

If you have a laptop:
- Go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options > System Settings
- Change what closing the lid does, set it to "Do nothing"
- Now you can close your laptop while the script is running, it will keep running
